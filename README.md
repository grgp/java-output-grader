# java-output-grader
Grades testcases by comparing their output with the correct expected output.

grader_kp2_2014 is a working example of the intended program. The program was initially built specifically for this instance.

grader_universal is currently under development, but in theory it should be able to be used with any java source code that uses testcases that compares outputs.
